   This time control is not supported by the game clock and TimeTracker. This time control works like this:
    - At the beginning of the play the clock should wait for the delay period.
    - If the user makes a play before the delay the players keeps his original time.
    - I the player makes a play after the delay, he retains the consumed time after the delay.
